*Le Baiser au Lépreux* (The Kiss to the Leper) is a novel by [François Mauriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac) published in 1922.  François Mauriac was a renowned french writer, member of the [Académie Française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise) and laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1952.  The Kiss to the Leper is a short novel, spanning just over one hundred pages but the style is remarkable, concise yet not rushed. Like the novel, the chapters are not long and can be almost assimilated to a scene in a play.

The book follows the life of the Péloueyre family, and especially the son Jean, an ugly man, avoiding people at all costs and spending most of this time hunting or going to the church by himself, who is going to be married, following the action of the local priest, to an ingenuous woman named Noémi. The action takes place in a town in the south west of France, where François Mauriac was born and raised.

The priest seems, at that time, to have a strong influence over the life of the town. People were more religious, especially in the countryside. So the priest was likely to know a lot of things as people were confessing to him.

A lot of characters in the novel, which contains very few, contract tuberculosis, which was called the white plague in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It is estimated than over 10 millions people died from [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis) in France during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. One measure to counter this illness was to build sanatoriums, like the [Paimio Sanatorium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNlvqwXjBX4) in Finland, completed in 1933 and designed by Alvar Aalto, which has recently even been nominated to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

At one point during the novel, the main character, Jean, goes to Paris, mostly to escape from his wife. This trip seems extraordinary at the time. I can't imagine what people in the 22<sup>th</sup> century will think of today’s travel possibilities? “10 hours flight to get to Beijing, I just did that last week in 30 minutes!”. Maybe not so far off, as it [has been proposed](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16383048/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-transport-earth-travel) by Elon Musk last year. Wait and see.
