I was in [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon) a few weeks back and because of the rail strikes, there were no cheap high-speed train tickets available on the sunday night that I was going back to Paris. So I had to take an old train which took me from Lyon to the French capital in four hours and a half instead of less than two hours with a regular [TGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV). At least, the scenery were quite splendid and the relative speed of the train did allow to really enjoy it.

But I still had to find ways to make the time pass and I did, watching [*No Direction Home*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367555/), the documentary about Bob Dylan directed by Martin Scorsese. It was released in 2005 and is quite long, with a three hours length. The documentary depicts the journey of Bob Dylan from the time he came to New York City in 1961 to the his motorcycle accident in July 1966, just after the end of his European Tour.

I'm quite fond of Bob Dylan. I know most of the songs from his first albums, the ones that were released before 1966. I even got the chance to see him live in Nantes in 2010. It was not so good, to say the least, but it was still quite mesmerizing to be 20 meters away from this legend while he was singing *Mr Tambourine Man*, even if it was miles away from his performance at the *Newport Folk Festival* in 1964!

The documentary is interesting, mostly thanks to the footage from back then, the recent interviews were not so compelling. Is it really meaningful to have people blabbering stories about what happened 40 years down the line? And I would have instead loved to know more about Bob Dylan's life before he moved to NYC. Maybe it would have been a good idea to interview members of his family, even if I'm sure, they would have been quite reluctant to do so. But when Martin Scorsese is the one asking, it's different right?

I was amazed by the fact that most of the songs from that time were recorded in a total uncanny way. Barely rehearsed and considered good enough to appear on the record after only one or two takes. I've never wrote a song but it seems quite extraordinary to have songs, that are still considered amongst the best ever recorded, even today, to have been recorded that way. It really shows the genius of Dylan at that period.

Finally, It's quite sad to see that mainstream journalists were already completely ignorant and only interested by their thinking and not even trying to grasp the person that they were interviewing, here Bob Dylan, which found himself answering the [stupidest questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnl5X5MQKTg), day after day.

After watching this documentary, I'd clearly like to know more about the life of Bob Dylan so I have added his memoir [Chronicles: Volume One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles:_Volume_One) to my booklist. A review of this book can be expected shortly, but probably not before 2024 though!
