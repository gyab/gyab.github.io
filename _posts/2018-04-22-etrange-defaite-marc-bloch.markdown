description: A few thoughts on Strange Defeat, a testimony on the Battle of France written in 1940 by French officer and historian, Marc Bloch.

As this is my first post, I just quickly want to explain what bring me to write it. 

It will be about reading. Because even if I don’t find myself reading all that much, I feel like I could at least get more out of the books I read. It’s easy, quite easier actually, to read a book without really taking the time to process the meaning of each sentence or paragraph and to turn one page after another without taking notes or think twice about something maybe not so easy to grasp in its entirety. Well that’s what I used to do at least! But I have decided to make some changes, and now take the time necessary to reflect at least once I will finish a book and write a few things down – and maybe an article like this one about it. By writing things down, I will try to summarize what I learned and thought of the book. 

Writing is the first step towards creating a system that would help me better retain the informations or ideas that I found valuable in something that I read, let that be a book or an article on the Internet. Today, I sometimes highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs on my Kindle but I don’t really do much with them. The only thing I’m actually doing is adding the words I don’t know (either English or French), to my [Anki account][anki-website], a spaced repetition flashcard program, to learn them more efficiently.

The book I’m going to introduce, [“L’Étrange défaite”][strange-defeat] (*Strange Defeat*), is a book written by Marc Bloch in July 1940, a month after France had surrendered to the Third Reich. Marc Bloch was a French historian, who fought in the trenches during the first World War and who was a captain during the short [Battle of France][battle-of-france] in 1940. He would then joined the French Resistance in 1942 and fought until he was captured in 1944 by the Vichy police and handed over to the Gestapo. He was executed by a firing squad on the night of 16 June 1944, ten days after the Normandy landings. In this book, Bloch described what he witnessed during the Battle of France and also tried to explain how the Fall of France can have been so sudden.

To write this article, I am expanding a few notes I wrote quickly, on a small notebook, a few days after I finished reading this book. 

In the first part of his book, Bloch described the French Army as unprepared but confident in its ability to fight the Wehrmacht. Even the rapid invasion of Poland by the German forces in September 1939 had no effect on the way French Generals were envisioning the coming conflict. “The Battle of France” would then only last 43 days, and demonstrated once again the implacable superiority of the German forces. Bloch, when he exposes the errors committed by the French, blames at numerous occasions the oldness of the people in charge of the French military. Stating that most young officers who hadn’t fought during the first World War had better insights that their superiors, for whom this new World War was not going to be so much different that the previous one. Bloch writes, a few pages later, than contrary to the French, “The Nazi Revolution put in command”, whether at the head of the army or of the state, men, whom because they were young and hadn’t been brainwashed, were more capable to understand “the surprising or the new”.

Bloch, not only blames the French military but also condemns, on multiple occasions, the French institutions. For example, the elitist schools like “Sciences Po” or [Polytechnique][polytechnique], which “only educated notables’s children”. Children, which would later on, obtain high positions, for example, in embassies or in government. For Bloch, the elites were completely out of touch with the working class, the majority of the French population, and were only guided by their self-interest. Bloch also writes that “a country is suffering, when the people in charge of the public institutions are hostile to those very same institutions”.

On a more personal level, two things in this book, caught my attention. First, the way Bloch writes. Even if this book is almost 80 years old, I found Bloch's writing quite demanding, even compared to French authors from the 50s or the 60s. It probably has to do with the fact that Bloch, who was born in 1886, was a highly recognized historian and professor for whom language was not just a tool but something of the highest importance. I’ve had, at multiples times, even difficulties to understand some of his sentences. I don’t know anything about linguistics, but it is quite surprising to see how we can express ourselves so differently, even just a few decades apart. 

The second thing that caught my attention, is when the action in the book is taking place in [Rennes][rennes], a city in Brittany, and especially when Bloch referenced the “Boulevard Sévigné”, one of the roads used by the German forces in June 1940 to enter the city. I lived in Rennes for quite some time, and I was, at one point, living in an apartment located on a street adjacent to the Boulevard Sévigné. Imagining someone sitting at his kitchen table eating breakfast, be surprised to hear tanks or at least some unknown large vehicles in the distance. And then, probably standing up to get a look out of one near window while thinking of the disastrous latest news of the war shared by a neighbour the evening before, and be even more surprised and speechless to see germans soldiers all over the place, just wandering freely in the city he's been living for some years now.

Overall, *[Strange Defeat][strange-defeat-amazon]* is a really interesting book, from which a lot can be learn, even today. When Bloch wrote this book, France had just surrendered and its future was dependent of the good will of Adolf Hitler. But even those circumstances couldn't totally affect Bloch, who was still hopeful and even confident that France would at some point get its sovereignty back. And also hopeful that when that day would come, the people in charge would make the necessary changes at every level of the society (politics, education, military...) to avoid history from repeating itself.
